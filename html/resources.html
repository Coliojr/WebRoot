<a href="https://circuitstream.com/blog/what-is-lidar" target="_blank">LiDAR Sensor</a><br />
An all encompasing explanation of what LiDAR is, and how it is used in mobile devices. 
While succint and easily digestable in roughly 10 minuets, 
this resource provides through understanding on what types of applications can make the most use of LiDAR technology. 
However, this is not limited to just mobile applications. There are other real world applications such as in Robotics, 
space exploration, autonomous vehicles, as well as tools for use in renewable technology. 
While useful as an introduction to the material and it uses, this resource does not include indepth guides on how to implement this sensor. Although links are provided to development workshops<br />

<a href="https://droid.news/explanation-this-is-how-the-built-in-pedometer-on-your-phone-works/" target="_blank">Pedometer</a><br />
The pedometer sensor on a phone is used to track the amount of steps a user has taken. 
This article by Droid News takes an educational approach for users who may not be familiar with the technology. They explain the basics of how pedometers work from a users point of view but not a developers.
This serves as an ample introduction to the use of pedometers, but not for developers. With this, 
knowing the basics of pedometers and seeing how an app might utilize these sensors with the provided links can be a great 
starting point of discovery for prospecting developers resarching the use of mobile phone sensors.

<a href="https://nextnav.com/why-phones-have-barometers/" target="_blank">Barometer</a><br />
A barometer is not something that you might think would be included in a phone and have its uses, but it certainly does. 
This article provided by nextnav goes over the uses of barometers in smart phones, what they do and how they work. 
Barometers in particualr are useful in conjuction with GPS systems to accurately provide vertical location data. 
This resource is usful when beginning learning about these sensors because it gives a foundation on what its use cases might be and how it can aid users.<br />

<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-fingerprint-scanners-work-670934/" target="_blank">Biometrics</a><br />
More commonplace than before is the use of biometric data in smart devices. Covered are the types of biometric scanners used in our phones. 
This includes fingerprint scanners, capacitive scanners, as well as ultrasonic fingerprint scanners. 
Along with this is information about its use in regards to security. 
Both securing the users private data, as well as using biometrics for things like secure entry into devices. 
Again, with all of these uses explained it gives developers a pool of information to help brainstorm ideas with.<br />

<a href="https://www.credencys.com/blog/accelerometer/" target="_blank">Accelerometer</a><br />
The accelerometer in an imporant sensor in mobile devices that "measures for of acceleration caused by movement or by gravity or by vibration".
Because they work using gravity, they are used to detect how a device is moving. 
This source summarized the uses and how the sensor works and how it can be beneficial to have in our devices.
